# test-strategy
Examples of various test strategies

The idea is to show that often regular testing strategy does not work.

# Introduction
Standard testing strategy can be described using so-called testing pyramid: many low-level unit tests,
less integration tests even less system tests etc. This is because typically people believe that 
writing using tests is simpler and easier. Unit tests should check every feature of every unit (class), 
integration tests verify whether modules (classes) can work with each other etc. 

This project contains examples for a presentation that shows when this methodology does not work well and 
suggests other testing approach.
